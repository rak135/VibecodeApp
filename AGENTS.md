# Agent Instructions

## Before you start

1. Run `python -m vibecode.cli context . --task "<task>"` to generate a task-specific context pack; start from `Relevant files with reasons`.
2. Read `.vibecode/architecture/INVARIANTS.md` and `.vibecode/architecture/STRUCTURE.md` when present.
3. Read `.vibecode/handoff/NOW.md` for current scope.
4. Check `.vibecode/checks/required_checks.yaml` for required checks.

## Source of truth

Treat source code, tests, `PRD.json`, and human-maintained docs (`.vibecode/architecture/`, `.vibecode/handoff/`, `.vibecode/checks/`, `.vibecode/history/`, `.vibecode/agents/`) as truth.

## Do not manually edit

- `.vibecode/current/*` — session state
- `.vibecode/index/*` — generated index outputs except `README.md` and `schema.json`
- `.vibecode/generated/*` — export artifacts
- `.vibecode/logs/*` — runtime logs
- `.vibecode/runs/*` — run metadata
- `.vibecode/tmp/*` — temporary files
- `.vibecode/cache/*` — cache files

## Rules

- Do not perform unrelated refactors.
- Do not modify protected files without an explicit task.
- Do not edit README unless the task explicitly scopes README/docs; only edit generated blocks if future markers exist.
- Run required checks before finalizing changes.
- Report changed files and checks run before marking work complete.
- Update the handoff document when done.

## Available commands

- `vibecode init` — initialize `.vibecode/` project layer
- `vibecode index` — scan and generate architecture maps
- `vibecode inventory` — scan files; produce context cards and a risk report (run before `dashboard` or `serve`)
- `vibecode context` — generate task-scoped context pack
- `vibecode map` — print one-page project summary
- `vibecode validate` — check artifact consistency (run this first)
- `vibecode guard` — check diff against protected/generated paths
- `vibecode check` — run required checks from `.vibecode/checks/required_checks.yaml`
- `vibecode handoff-check` — validate handoff file quality
- `vibecode run` — explicitly orchestrate an external OpenCode run and then run guard/check/handoff; use `--guard-mode advisory` (default) or `--guard-mode strict`
- `vibecode monitor` — two-pane TUI that runs an OpenCode session and streams output live (streaming text mode, not a PTY); left pane agent stdout/stderr, right pane Vibecode event spine (requires `[tui]` extra: `pip install -e ".[tui]"`)
- `vibecode runs list` — list recent run session IDs from `.vibecode/runs/`
- `vibecode runs show <session_id> [--events]` — show summary for a previous run; `--events` replays all events in order
- `vibecode run-plan` — assemble an agent run plan without launching it
- `vibecode history` — manage durable history summaries
- `vibecode project` — manage the local project registry outside the repo
- `vibecode export-agents` — write/update root AGENTS.md
- `vibecode dashboard` — open an interactive TUI showing context cards, symbols, facts, and heuristics (requires `[tui]` extra: `pip install -e ".[tui]"`)
- `vibecode serve` — start an MCP stdio server exposing `get_file_card`, `find_symbol`, and `list_high_risk` for OpenCode (requires `[mcp]` extra: `pip install -e ".[mcp]"`)
